VyxHub Production Readiness Assessment
Date: February 19, 2026

STRENGTHS:
* Error Handling: A global ErrorBoundary component is implemented to catch unhandled React errors and display a user-friendly fallback UI.
* Environment Variables: supabase.js strictly validates the presence of required environment variables at startup.
* Build & Deployment: The project uses Vite for fast builds and optimized bundling. App.jsx uses React.lazy and Suspense to code-split routes, significantly reducing the initial bundle size.

MISSING ELEMENTS:
* Error Tracking: The ErrorBoundary currently only logs to console.error. There is no production error tracking service (like Sentry) to monitor client-side exceptions in the wild.
* Monitoring & Alerting: There is no setup for monitoring database performance, API latency, or edge function errors, nor are there alerts for critical failures.
* Database Backups: It is not verified if automated, point-in-time recovery (PITR) backups are enabled in the Supabase project settings.
