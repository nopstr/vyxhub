VyxHub Feature Polishness Assessment
Date: February 19, 2026

STRENGTHS:
* UI Consistency: Tailwind CSS is used for consistent styling, and the application structure utilizes a well-organized component library (src/components/ui).
* Loading States: PageLoader and Suspense fallbacks provide visual feedback during asynchronous operations.
* User Feedback: The sonner library is integrated for toast notifications, providing immediate feedback for user actions.

AREAS FOR POLISH:
* Accessibility (a11y): The application needs a thorough accessibility audit to ensure all interactive elements have proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation works seamlessly, and color contrast meets WCAG standards.
* Empty States: Many lists (feeds, messages, notifications, bookmarks) lack well-designed empty states to guide users when no content is available.
* Image Optimization: Uploaded media needs to be properly compressed and served in modern formats (e.g., WebP) to improve load times and reduce bandwidth costs, especially for the feed and reels.
