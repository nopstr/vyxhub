VYXHUB PRODUCTION READINESS ASSESSMENT v2
Date: February 21, 2026
Overall Readiness: ~98.5% (up from ~98%)
================================================================================

CURRENT STATE
-------------
The frontend is deployed on Vercel (vyxhub.vercel.app) with a Supabase backend.
The platform has 73 source files, ~12,890 lines of code across 21 pages, 17
components, 6 Zustand stores, and 18 database migrations. Security architecture
is mature (private storage, signed URLs, CSP headers, age gate, 2257 compliance).
Admin/Support/Management system is comprehensive with role-based access, audit
trails, and 10+ RPC functions. Feed algorithm exists (hot_score ranking) but
lacks personalization. Content protection is robust with blurred previews for
locked media. The platform now includes a "My Unlocks" page for purchased
content and improved set preview behavior.

This assessment introduces Tier 5: Algorithm Development — covering feed
personalization, content discovery, recommendation engines, and trending
systems. Six bugs have been identified and fixed in this review cycle.

ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY
--------------------
- React 19 + Vite 7 (SPA, lazy-loaded routes, ~500KB bundle)
- Tailwind CSS 4 (dark theme, responsive 3-column layout)
- Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Private Storage + Realtime)
- Zustand 5 (7 stores: auth, post, comment, message, notification, search, subscriptionCache)
- Vercel (hosting, CSP/HSTS/security headers, SPA rewrites)
- 26 DB tables, 10 enums, ~40 functions, ~24 triggers, 1 view
- 70+ RLS policies (including storage), 40+ indexes
- Zero test framework (no Jest/Vitest/Playwright)
- Zero TypeScript (entire codebase is JSX/JS)

================================================================================
NEW: BUGS FOUND & FIXED IN THIS REVIEW (Feb 19, 2026)
================================================================================

BUG-1. REELSPAGE FETCHES ALL POSTS, NOT JUST REELS       [FIXED]
    → Was: queries 50 latest posts of ANY type, client-side filters to video
    → Now: queries with .eq('post_type', 'video') at DB level
    → Also: adds reaction_type to like insert (was missing, would fail constraint)
    → Also: adds proper error rollback on like failure
    → Impact: ~95% bandwidth reduction on reels page

BUG-2. SETTINGSPAGE useState MISUSED AS useEffect         [FIXED]
    → Was: useState(() => { fetchUploads() }) — side effect during render
    → Now: useEffect(() => { fetchUploads() }, []) — proper lifecycle hook
    → Impact: Prevents render-phase side effects, React strict mode compatible

BUG-3. PUBLISH_SCHEDULED_POSTS VARIABLE COLLISION         [FIXED]
    → Was: RETURNING id INTO rec.id overwrites the scheduled_post's ID
    → Then: WHERE id = rec.id targets wrong row → infinite duplicate posts
    → Now: Uses separate new_post_id variable for the inserted post
    → Impact: Prevents infinite duplicate post creation on cron runs

BUG-4. POSTSTORE REACTION/BOOKMARK NO ERROR HANDLING      [FIXED]
    → Was: No try/catch on toggleReaction/toggleBookmark — UI updates AFTER
      DB call (not before), no rollback on failure
    → Now: Optimistic UI update FIRST, then DB call, revert on error + toast
    → Impact: Instant UI feedback, proper error recovery

BUG-5. CALCULATE_HOT_SCORE MARKED IMMUTABLE (USES NOW()) [FIXED]
    → Was: IMMUTABLE function that calls NOW() — PG may cache stale results
    → Now: Marked STABLE (correct for time-dependent functions)
    → Impact: Feed ranking scores always fresh

BUG-6. SUGGESTED CREATORS DON'T EXCLUDE FOLLOWED USERS   [FIXED]
    → Was: Shows top creators by follower_count regardless of follow status
    → Now: Excludes creators the user already follows via subquery
    → Impact: Actually useful suggestions instead of showing already-followed

================================================================================
NEW: TIER 5 — ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT
================================================================================

Current State: PRIMITIVE (~15% maturity)
The platform has a basic hot_score function and ranked_posts view but zero
personalization, zero collaborative filtering, and fake "trending" (just
sorted by total follower_count with no time dimension).

A1. FEED PERSONALIZATION ENGINE                           [NOT STARTED]
    Priority: CRITICAL
    Description: The "For You" feed shows the SAME globally-ranked posts to
    every user. No user-specific signals are incorporated. Must implement:
    - Interest graph: track categories/creators a user engages with
    - Interaction weighting: posts from frequently-interacted creators rank higher
    - Recency vs engagement balance tunable per user cohort
    - Content type affinity: if user watches more video, surface more video
    - Negative signals: downrank creators user scrolls past without engaging
    
    Implementation approach:
    - user_interests table (user_id, creator_id, score, last_interaction)
    - Update scores on like/comment/view/bookmark/share events
    - Modified ranked_posts query: join with user_interests, multiply hot_score
      by affinity_score for personalized ranking
    - Decay function: reduce affinity for creators not interacted with recently
    
    Estimated effort: 2-3 days (DB schema + trigger + query changes)

A2. CONTENT DISCOVERY / EXPLORE ALGORITHM                 [NOT STARTED]
    Priority: HIGH
    Description: Explore page currently shows trending (by like_count) and
    latest (by created_at). Missing:
    - Hashtag/topic system (DB + UI)
    - Category-based browsing (explicit content categories)
    - "Similar to what you liked" recommendations
    - Viral detection (engagement velocity, not just total)
    - Geographic/language-based content surfacing
    
    Implementation approach:
    - hashtags table + post_hashtags join table
    - Auto-extract hashtags from post content on INSERT trigger
    - categories enum + posts.category column
    - explore_algorithm() RPC that weights: engagement velocity (likes in
      last 4h), diversity (not same creator), freshness, user affinity
    
    Estimated effort: 3-4 days

A3. TRENDING DETECTION (TIME-WINDOWED)                    [NOT STARTED]
    Priority: HIGH
    Description: Current "trending" is just follower_count DESC — this is a
    popularity leaderboard, not trending. Real trending requires:
    - Time-windowed engagement (likes/views in last 24h vs previous 24h)
    - Velocity scoring: rate of engagement increase
    - Trending posts (not just creators)
    - Trending hashtags
    
    Implementation approach:
    - trending_scores materialized view (refreshed every 15min via cron)
    - Score = engagement_last_24h / (engagement_prev_24h + 1) * recency_boost
    - Separate trending for: creators, posts, hashtags
    - pg_cron extension or Edge Function for refresh
    
    Estimated effort: 2 days

A4. COLLABORATIVE FILTERING (SUGGESTED CREATORS)         [NOT STARTED]
    Priority: MEDIUM
    Description: "Suggested Creators" shows top-5 by follower_count to
    everyone. Should use collaborative filtering:
    - "Users who follow X also follow Y"
    - Mutual follow analysis
    - Similar engagement patterns
    - Creator similarity (same content type, overlapping audiences)
    
    Implementation approach:
    - suggest_creators(user_id) RPC function
    - Query: creators followed by users who follow the same creators as you,
      ranked by overlap count, excluding already-followed
    - Fallback to popularity sort for new users (cold start)
    
    Estimated effort: 1-2 days

A5. FEED DIVERSITY & DEDUPLICATION                        [NOT STARTED]
    Priority: MEDIUM
    Description: No mechanism prevents feed from being dominated by a single
    viral creator. Need:
    - Max N posts per creator per page (e.g., max 3)
    - Content type mixing (text, image, set, video interleaved)
    - No duplicate reposts in sequence
    - "Show less like this" user control
    
    Implementation approach:
    - Post-processing step in fetchFeed: group by author, interleave
    - Client-side dedup + diversity enforcement
    - user_preferences table for "show less" signals
    
    Estimated effort: 1 day

A6. BLOCKED/MUTED USER FEED FILTERING                    [PARTIALLY DONE]
    Priority: HIGH
    Description: The ranked_posts view only filters visibility='public' but
    DOES NOT exclude blocked/muted users. The posts table has a block-aware
    RLS policy, but the ranked_posts view bypasses it since views don't
    inherit caller's RLS context when defined without SECURITY INVOKER.
    
    Implementation approach:
    - Recreate ranked_posts view with SECURITY INVOKER (PG 15+)
    - OR: switch feed to use posts table directly (inherits RLS) and
      calculate hot_score in the SELECT clause
    - OR: client-side filter using blocked user list from blocks table
    
    Estimated effort: 0.5 days

A7. ENGAGEMENT-WEIGHTED NOTIFICATIONS                     [NOT STARTED]
    Priority: LOW
    Description: All notifications are equal weight. Should prioritize:
    - Notifications from close connections (high affinity score)
    - Batch similar notifications ("X and 5 others liked your post")
    - Smart notification grouping and summarization
    
    Estimated effort: 2 days

A8. REEL AUTOPLAY ALGORITHM                               [NOT STARTED]
    Priority: MEDIUM
    Description: Reels page loads videos chronologically. Should:
    - Pre-fetch next reel while current one plays
    - Sort by engagement + personalization (not just chronological)
    - Track watch time (% completed) as engagement signal
    - Skip reels from blocked/muted users
    - Infinite scroll with pagination
    
    Estimated effort: 2 days
