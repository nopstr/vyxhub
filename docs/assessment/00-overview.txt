================================================================================
VYXHUB PRODUCTION READINESS ASSESSMENT
Date: February 19, 2026
Overall Readiness: ~82% (up from ~70%)
================================================================================

CURRENT STATE
-------------
The frontend is deployed on Vercel (vyxhub.vercel.app) with a Supabase backend.
Basic scaffolding is solid — 17 DB tables, 8 enums, 55+ RLS policies, clean UI
component library, dark-theme design, real-time subscriptions wired up. No money
can move yet (payment integration pending), but all Tier 0 security issues, all
Tier 1 critical bugs, all Tier 2 high-priority issues (except H1/H2 payments),
all Tier 3 medium-priority polish issues, and all implementable Tier 4 missing
features have been resolved. Content is protected (text + media), legal compliance
basics are in place, UI accessibility is improved, feed state is preserved, media
uploads are parallel, and comprehensive social features (reporting, blocking,
threading, search, pinning, reposts, account deletion, email/password change,
subscription management) are now fully functional.

ONE REMAINING EXISTENTIAL BLOCKER
-----------------------------------
1. No money can move (no payment integration — Stripe Connect needed)

ESTIMATED TIMELINE
------------------
- Real MVP (Phase 3 remaining): 2-3 weeks of focused work
- Feature parity with top platforms (all phases): 3-6 months

NEXT PRIORITIES
---------------
1. Phase 3: Payment integration (Stripe Connect — H1/H2, the existential blocker)
2. Phase 5: High-complexity features (F9 Livestreaming, F10 Stories, F13 Mass Messaging)
